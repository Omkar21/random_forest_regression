# random_forest_regression

I have completed the "Machine Learning : A-Z" course delivered on udemy platform. In this project, I have implemented the random forest regression model to predict the salaries as per the years of experience. 

Following Python libraries used for implementation:

Pandas - for data preprocessing.
Numpy - for data preprocessing.
sklearn - to implement the Random forest regression model.
matplotlib - to plot the results
